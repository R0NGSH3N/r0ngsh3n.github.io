Using Graphic interface on WSL2, the most popular way is Xfce4 + VcxSrv. But I would like provide different way with Xrdp + remote desktop from win10.

Following are the steps(assume you have ubuntu installed on WSL):

1. Update and Upgrade
~~~bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
~~~
2. Install Xorg 
~~~bash
sudo apt install xorg
~~~
3. Install Xfce4
~~~bash
sudo apt install xfce4
~~~
4. Install Xrdp
~~~bash
sudo apt install xrdp
~~~
5. Set up port for Xrdp
~~~bash
sudo sed -i 's/port=3389/port=3390/g' /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini
~~~
6. Write Xfce4-session into Xsession
~~~bash
sudo echo xfce4-session >~/.xsession
~~~
7. Restart Xrdp service
~~~bash
sudo service xrdp restart
~~~

Once above done, then you can go to windows, start "remote desktop connection" and in the dialog box input : "127.0.0.1:3390", you should see the xfce4 desktop on your screen.
